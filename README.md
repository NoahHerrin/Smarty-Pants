Smart Pants

While it is cliche confidence is key.
The way you start your day plays a huge role in how the rest of the day will play out. Sleeping through an alarm will ruin a day, while wearing your favorite shirt will make a midterm day feel manageable. However unless you want to wake up at 5 or empty your entire closet on the floor for an impromptu fashion show getting that confidence from for the perfect outfit can be a lot of work. Maybe this is just me who knows.

Smarty pants offers a simple and clean interface that allows a user to sample dozens of potential outfits from their wardrobe in the time it would take to put a pair of pants on. Not only will you be able to quickly sample various outfits but Smarty Pants will learn from your likes and dislikes in order to improve suggestions.
