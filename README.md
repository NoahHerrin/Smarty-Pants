# Smarty-Pants (Remodel In-Progress)
By Noah Herrin
## Purpose
  To use a Dijkstra / Graph machine learning algorithm to intelligently put outfits together based on a person's personal preferences and various other factors (weather, activity, dress-codes). 

## Learning Goals
  My main goal for this project is to gain an understanding of how machine learning stores it's information,
  how it learns, and how new data is processed

## To Do List
 - [x] make graph datastructure
 - [x] make clothing item datastructure
 - [x] link clothing datastructure and graph datastructure together
 - [x] create the self expanding struture for the graph
 - [x] add functions to mass manipulate the edges of the graph
 - [ ] create terminal interface
 - [ ] use terminal interface to manipulate edges
