Intended Style Guide for Smarty Pants
By Noah Herrin

The goal of this project is to use the NumPy Style python docstrings
https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html

Purpose: 
By using doc strings 
example.
"""this is a doc string"""
then the code has the example to print out said comment like this
> def get_max(a,b):
>    """returns the maximum value of a and b"""
>    return a if a > b else b
> print(get_max.__doc__)
returns the maximum value of a and b
