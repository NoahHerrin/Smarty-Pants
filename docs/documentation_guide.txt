Intended Style Guide for Smarty Pants
By Noah Herrin

The goal of this project is to use the NumPy Style python docstrings
https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html

UnitTests
---------
use 'python -m unittest tests.test_vertex' to run tests

General Strategy
    Test allowed input Types
    Test results
    Test edge cases

Note 

    
Error Types
-----------

TypeError
    When type of a parameter is incorrect

AttributeError
    Issue when referencing or modifying an objects attributes

IndexError
    When index is out of bounds for a list

SyntaxError
    When a syntax error occurs when parsing

NotImplementedError
    raised when a feature is not implemented

ValueError
    When the value is something you don't like


Interesting Bug Sources
-----------------------
instanceof(bool, int)
    Since a bool is simply a 1 or a 0, isinstance won't return false
    this can be fixed easy by adding isinstance(variable, int) and 
    not isinstance(variable, bool)
